# Analysis-of-Malaria-Trends-And-Insights-In-Africa-From-2007-2017
This project analyzed malaria trends in Africa (2007â€“2017), highlighting Congo, Dem. Rep. as the highest in cases and Burkina Faso in incidence rates. It also explored links between urbanization, sanitation, and malaria prevalence to inform public health decisions. The following insights were uncovered from the analysis:

**KEY INSIGHTS**

Malaria cases steadily increased from 2007 to 2017, peaking at 128 million cases in 2017.

Congo, Dem. Rep. reported the highest malaria cases (78M), followed by Mozambique, Burkina Faso, and Uganda.

Burkina Faso has the highest malaria incidence rate (5.3 per 1,000 population at risk).

Rural populations (56.84%) dominate compared to urban populations (43.16%), likely leading to greater exposure to malaria vectors.

High-malaria-incidence countries like Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic also show low basic sanitation levels.

Urban growth is notable in countries like Equatorial Guinea and Burundi, which may impact malaria trends.

Countries with higher basic sanitation service usage (e.g., Libya) report fewer malaria cases.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Strengthen nationwide malaria prevention strategies, such as insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and access to antimalarial drugs, especially in high-burden regions.

Focus on these high-burden countries with targeted funding and interventions, including enhanced surveillance and localized health campaigns.

Increase community health programs in Burkina Faso, including mass drug administration, malaria vaccination, and environmental management.

Expand rural health outreach programs, improve rural sanitation, and provide greater access to malaria prevention tools in these areas.

Combine malaria prevention efforts with improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities to address root causes effectively.

Implement urban planning strategies that incorporate mosquito control measures, such as proper drainage systems and waste management, in rapidly urbanizing regions.

Prioritize investments in basic sanitation infrastructure in low-usage countries to help mitigate malaria transmission.
